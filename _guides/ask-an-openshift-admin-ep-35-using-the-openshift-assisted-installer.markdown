There are several different methods to deploy OpenShift to your hyperscaler, hypervisor, or hardware platform of choice. One of the easiest is with the Assisted Installer, which provides an interactive experience where you are able to see, modify, and configure the cluster options then boot the nodes to an ISO and let the install run. No generating ignition configs. No attaching or hosting them. Just boot an ISO and youâ€™re ready to go!
