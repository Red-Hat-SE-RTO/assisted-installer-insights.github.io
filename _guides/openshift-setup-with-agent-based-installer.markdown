The Agent-based installer provides a new simplified and flexible way to install on-premise OpenShift clusters - with a focus for disconnected or air-gapped environments - powered by the Assisted Installer technology.
Through a new OpenShift installer subcommand, it'd be possible to create a single bootable ISO containing all the required information to deploy automatically all the cluster nodes - and without the need of a dedicated provisioning host.

The goal of this lightning talks is to introduce the audience to such new installation approach, by providing a quick insight on how it works and which uses cases it wants to address, and by describing the main steps of a typical deployment.
